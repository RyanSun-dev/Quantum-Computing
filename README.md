# Graph-Quantum-Machine-Learning
Based on Graph Theory, simulate quantum algorithms using the power of Graph Machine Learning.
create KI (krishna's intelligence) using grap neural network at its core.
things to study
1. graph theory 
2. graph neural networks -> math behind neural networks, graph fourier transforms, math behind graph neural networks
3. quantume mechanics


Initial goal
 - Understand fourier transforms and try to code it out (eow)
